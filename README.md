Auto-scaling is a useful feature in cloud computing that automatically adjusts resources based on how much they are needed. If the CPU usage goes above 75%, more virtual machines (VMs) are created to handle the load. When the CPU usage drops, the extra VMs are removed. This helps keep things running smoothly and ensures that companies only use and pay for the resources they actually need.
